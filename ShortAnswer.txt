1. Assume I plan to use the friend_overlap function above to quantify the
similarity of two users. E.g., because 344 is larger than 1, I conclude that
Jill Stein and Gary Johnson are more similar than Hillary Clinton and Donald
Trump.

How is this approach misleading? How might you fix it?

>>>This approach is misleading because although friend_overlap function gives us the common friends between 2 users, it doesnt quantify in 
what context the users are similar. May if had known that all the overlaps are on twitter handles for news organisations, their reporters, immediate support staff and political party members.
We could say that Jill Stein and Gary Johnson are similar to each other in terms of having similar users.

It also happens that political leaders/party members change their political parties which might also be a reason to have overlaps between any of the 2 presendential candidates.
To fix this we need a co-relation between the presential candidates and their follow list user accounts using a quantity something like 'relativeness' which can probably 
hold values like 'Colleague', 'Friend', 'News Agency', etc.
The co-relation can also be defined using other techniques, the above example is merely what I could think of.

2. Looking at the output of your followed_by_hillary_and_donald function, why
do you think this user is followed by both Hilary Clinton and Donald Trump,
who are rivals? Do some web searches to see if you can find out more
information.

>>>The White House twitter handle is the official twitter handle for the President of The United States (POTUS) and his administration.
Both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are following this handle as they have the connection of being a part of the Presidental administration.
For Donald Trump being the current President of the United States, official tweets are send from him or his administration are either tweeted/re-tweeted 
by the White house twitter handle. For Hillary Clinton she was First Lady of United States from Jan 1993 to Jan 2001 and the United States Secretary of state 
which makes her a part of Presidental administration (twice). Hence I would come to a conclusion to why Whitehouse twitter is being followed by both of them.

3. There is a big difference in how many accounts each candidate follows (Gary
Johnson follows over 3K accounts, while Donald Trump follows less than
50). Why do you think this is? How might that affect our analysis?

>>>Online social platforms like Twitter began to show their true power in Obama's presidential campaign in 2008 (refer account usage 
history on the wiki page mentioned below). So in the recent elections the strategy has been similar for some of the presidential candidates.
In our case, on having a cursory glance at the followers for Gary Johnson, I can deduce is that the twitter handle for Gary Johnson has followed 
news channels, reporters,student organisation,etc to gain a direct connect to the voter base. It also might be a way of reaching the masses.

In case of Donald Trump, although his follows list has less than 50 user accounts, most of which are either family, personal managers or his company handles.
Which would give us the presumption that Trump didnt had a direct connect to his masses, but due to his effective use of

4. The follower graph we've collected is incomplete. To expand it, we would
have to also collect the list of accounts followed by each of the
friends. That is, for each user X that Donald Trump follows, we would have to
also collect all the users that X follows. Assuming we again use the API call
https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/get/friends/ids, how many requests will
we have to make? Given how Twitter does rate limiting
(https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public/rate-limiting), approximately how many
minutes will it take to collect this data?

>>>From the output of Friends per candidate function we have the below :
DrJillStein 1648
GovGaryJohnson 3481
HillaryClinton 762
realDonaldTrump 45

This totals upto 5936 user accounts, now since we are using the API call again
we have a rate limit of 15 requests per request windows which lasts for 15 mins.
Assuming the best scenario, in which we only request for 15 requests in an iteration
we would need 5936/15 which gives us approximately 396 requests windows with 15 requests
each.

So we would need to make 5936 requests, with the above mentioned best case scenario, we will need 
396 request windows which woould take 396*15minutes = 5940 minutes to get that required data.
